# SPLAT!

A Terrestrial RF Path and Terrain Analysis Tool for Unix/Linux

## Getting Started

This version is a work in progress. It does exactly the same calculations as the basic
Splat! system, but uses CPU threading to speed things up.

Future version will either use OpenCL or Vulkan to hand computation off to a graphics
card in the hopes of even more speed improvements.
